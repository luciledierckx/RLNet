# Interpretable Rule Learning with Neural Networks
This repository contains the implementation for our work "RL-Net: Interpretable Rule Learning with Neural Networks", accepted to PAKDD 2023 (Oral).

This work was achieved by Lucile Dierckx, Rosana Veroneze and Siegfried Nijssen (UCLouvain/ICTEAM, Unicamp/FEEC).

The neural network can be fully translated to an ordered list of decision rules once trained.

To train and test the model, run the *train_and_test_model.py* or *train_and_test_model_ML.py* file.

### Dependencies
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. scitkit-learn
4. pytorch
